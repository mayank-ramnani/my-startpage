# my-startpage
A startpage for my browsers

---
## Need
Instead of setting up custom search engines in the browser to quickly find things, a page to make portability better.
Plan is to create a browser extension out of it that I can use on all my browsers.
Current new tab solutions are too heavy or don't offer the customizability I need.

## Future
- Autocomplete support
- Unsplash support to get random background image
- Editing of Search Engines to improve customizability.
- Time widget
